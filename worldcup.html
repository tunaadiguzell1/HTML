        <p>The 2022 FIFA World Cup is an international association football tournament contested by the men's national teams of FIFA's member associations. The 22nd FIFA World Cup, it is taking place in Qatar from 20 November to 18 December 2022. This is the first World Cup to be held in the Arab world, and the second held entirely in Asia after the 2002 tournament in South Korea and Japan.[A] At an estimated cost of over $220 billion, it is the most expensive World Cup ever held. France are the defending champions, having defeated Croatia 4–2 in the 2018 final.

            This tournament is scheduled to be the last with 32 participating teams, as the field will increase to 48 teams for the 2026 edition. Due to Qatar's intense summer heat and often fairly high humidity, this World Cup is being held during November and December.[B][1][2] It is being played in a reduced timeframe of 29 days. 64 matches are being played in eight venues across five cities. The opening match was between Qatar and Ecuador at Al Bayt Stadium, Al Khor. In their first-ever World Cup appearance, Qatar lost their opening game – the first host nation to do so.[3] After losing their first two games, Qatar were eliminated, the earliest a host team had been eliminated from the tournament,[4][5] and the third host nation not to progress past the first stage.[C] The final will be held on 18 December 2022 at Lusail Stadium, coinciding with Qatar's National Day.[6]</p>
